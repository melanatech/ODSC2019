# Shiny Workshop - Open Data Science Conference 2019

In this workshop, we'll be using [data](https://www.kaggle.com/schmadam97/nba-regular-season-stats-20182019) from the NBA 2018/19 season to explore the stats of NBA players with the help of a Shiny app. The final app we'll be building is [here](https://daattali.com/shiny/nba2018/) ([mirror](https://daattali.shinyapps.io/nba2018/))

Slides are available [here](https://github.com/daattali/shiny-workshop-odsc2019/raw/master/Shiny%20Workshop%20-%20ODSC%202019.pdf)

That's all you need to do! Don't worry about looking at any of the material, we'll cover it all in the workshop. All you need to do is steps 1-2-3.

The above steps assume that you'll have an internet connection during the workshop. Just in case you won't have internet, I suggest also doing the following 3 steps, to also have a copy of the material on your computer.

**Optional Step 1:** Install the following R packages: `shiny`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `DT`, `colourpicker`, `readr`. You can use this command in R to install all these packages at once:


    install.packages(c("shiny", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "DT", "colourpicker", "readr")) 


**Optional Step 2:** Go to https://github.com/daattali/shiny-workshop-odsc2019

**Optional Step 3:** Click on the green button *"Clone or download"* and then click on *"Download ZIP"*. Now you have all the necessary workshop materials on your computer.
